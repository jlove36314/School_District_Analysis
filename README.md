How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:


Math and reading scores by grade

It does not affect grades 10-12. It just has NAN for GR 9 THS


Scores by school spending

## Summary

The outcomes were not affected much if at all by removing the 9th graders from THS.  Therefore, we do not have enough evidence to suggest any academic dishonesty.
